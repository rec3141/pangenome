Testing the Infinitely Many Genes Model of the Bacterial Pangenome
R. Eric Collins and Paul G. Higgs

Any pair of closely related bacteria tends to share most---but not all---of the same genes. Usually, the number of core genes decreases slowly as new genomes are observed, while the size of the pangenome (the set of genes found on at least one of the genomes) increases because each genome contains new genes not observed in the others. We analyze 172 complete genomes of Bacilli to compare the properties of the pangenomes and core genomes of monophyletic subsets of this group, and to assess the capacities of evolutionary models to predict these properties. When subdivided into clades of different levels of diversity, including examples at the level of species, genus and higher taxonomic groups, more phylogenetically diverse groups are found to have smaller core genomes and larger pangenomes relative to the mean genome size for the group. The infinitely many genes (IMG) model is a population genetics model that allows prediction of the sizes of the core and pangenomes. It is based on the assumption that each new gene can arise only once, as would be the case for de novo gene invention or horizontal gene transfer from a highly diverse external gene pool. We consider variants of this model that allow for one or more classes of dispensable genes with different insertion and deletion rates, and for the possibility of a class of essential genes that must be present in all species. We show that the predictions of the model depend on the shape of the evolutionary tree that underlies the divergence of the genomes, and we calculate results for coalescent trees, star trees, and arbitrary phylogenetic trees of predefined fixed branch length. In general, we show that the IMG model is useful for comparison with experimental genome data both for species and for widely divergent groups.
